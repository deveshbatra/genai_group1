. An Introduction to AWS. And how we can be using it for MMM. Benefits of Cloud Computing. Trade upfront expense for variable expense.
Benefit from massive economies of scale.
Stop guessing capacity.
Increase speed and agility.
Stop spending money running and maintaining data centres.
Go global in minutes.
. Cloud Computing . Types of Deployment:
Cloud Based Deployment
All parts ran on the cloud, Existing applications migrated to the cloud, new apps designed and built on the cloud
On-Premise Deployment
Resources developed via virtualisation and resource management tools, increase resource utilisation using app management and virtualisation technologies
Hybrid Deployment
Connect cloud based resources to on premise infrastructure, integrate cloud based resources with legacy  IT infrastructure
. Cloud Migration. At the highest level, the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF) organizes guidance into six areas of focus, called Perspectives. Each Perspective addresses distinct responsibilities. The planning process helps the right people across the organization prepare for the changes ahead.
In general, the Business, People, and Governance Perspectives focus on business capabilities, whereas the Platform, Security, and Operations Perspectives focus on technical capabilities.

The Governance Perspective focuses on the skills and processes to align IT strategy with business strategy. This ensures that you maximize the business value and minimize risks.

Use the Governance Perspective to understand how to update the staff skills and processes necessary to ensure business governance in the cloud. Manage and measure cloud investments to evaluate business outcomes.. General governance. . Elastic Compute Cloud - EC2. EC2 provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud as Amazon EC2 instances. 
Imagine you are responsible for the architecture of your company's resources and need to support new websites. With traditional on-premises resources, you have to do the following:
Spend money upfront to purchase hardware.
Wait for the servers to be delivered to you.
Install the servers in your physical data center.
Make all the necessary configurations.
By comparison, with an Amazon EC2 instance you can use a virtual server to run applications in the AWS Cloud.
You can provision and launch an Amazon EC2 instance within minutes.
You can stop using it when you have finished running a workload.
You pay only for the compute time you use when an instance is running, not when it is stopped or terminated.
You can save costs by paying only for server capacity that you need or want.
. Serverless Computing. If you have applications that you want to run in Amazon EC2, you must do the following:
Provision instances (virtual servers).
Upload your code.
Continue to manage the instances while your application is running.

The term “serverless” means that your code runs on servers, but you do not need to provision or manage these servers. With serverless computing, you can focus more on innovating new products and features instead of maintaining servers.

Another benefit of serverless computing is the flexibility to scale serverless applications automatically. Serverless computing can adjust the applications' capacity by modifying the units of consumptions, such as throughput and memory. . AWS Lambda. AWS Lambda is a service that lets you run code without needing to provision or manage servers. 
While using AWS Lambda, you pay only for the compute time that you consume. Charges apply only when your code is running. You can also run code for virtually any type of application or backend service, all with zero administration. 
How AWS Lambda works
You upload your code to Lambda. 
You set your code to trigger from an event source, such as AWS services, mobile applications, or HTTP endpoints.
Lambda runs your code only when triggered.
You pay only for the compute time that you use. . Simple Storage Service- S3 Buckets. Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is a service that provides object-level storage. Amazon S3 stores data as objects in buckets.

When you upload a file to Amazon S3, you can set permissions to control visibility and access to it. You can also use the Amazon S3 versioning feature to track changes to your objects over time.


Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) is a service that provides block-level storage volumes that you can use with Amazon EC2 instances. If you stop or terminate an Amazon EC2 instance, all the data on the attached EBS volume remains available.. AWS Database services. Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a service that enables you to run relational databases in the AWS Cloud.
Amazon Aurora is an enterprise-class relational database. It is compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL relational databases. It is up to five times faster than standard MySQL databases and up to three times faster than standard PostgreSQL databases.
Amazon DynamoDB is a key-value database service. It delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale.
Amazon Redshift is a data warehousing service that you can use for big data analytics. It offers the ability to collect data from many sources and helps you to understand relationships and trends across your data.. Rds vs flat data placehodler. . Identity and Access Manager. AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) enables you to manage access to AWS services and resources securely.   

IAM gives you the flexibility to configure access based on your company’s specific operational and security needs. You do this by using a combination of IAM features:
IAM users, groups, and roles
IAM policies
Multi-factor authentication. Have a go yourself. Overall, your presentation is detailed and comprehensive, appealing to a technical audience. However, some improvements can help make it even more effective. Here are some suggestions:

1. **Introduction**: You need to have a more comprehensive introduction. Start by explaining what AWS is and what it does. Also, talk about MMM i.e., what it is, and how exactly AWS will specifically benefit MMM.

2. **Structuring information**: Re-arrange some information for better flow. For instance, you may want to talk about ‘Types of Deployment’ before explaining benefits of cloud computing. People need to understand what cloud deployment is, before they can understand its benefits.

3. **Simplify technical jargon**: Technical jargon needs to be carefully explained or substituted with simpler terms wherever applicable and possible. This will make it easier to follow for those audience members who may not be familiar with some of the jargon.

4. **Visuals/Graphics**: Consider attaching diagrams, charts, and infographics wherever possible. Visuals illustrating technical concepts can help your audience understand and retain information more easily.

5. **Governance Perspective**: While describing the governance perspective, do not forget to mention some example scenarios so that audiences can connect better.

6. **Unnecessary details**: Do avoid lengthy conversations or detailing about how AWS works. The audience should understand the worth and impact of using AWS rather than the process.

7. **Consistency in explanation**: While explaining EC2, you provided use cases, but this was missing while explaining services like Lambda, S3 or IAM. This creates inconsistency. Provide example scenarios or use cases for all such services.

8. **Conclusion**: Wrap up your presentation with a succinct conclusion. Highlight the key points covered, the benefits of using AWS and the impact it can make on the business infrastructure.

9. Don't forget to include an interactive Q&A session after your presentation to address any questions or concerns your audience may have.

10. **Practice**: Delivering technical information can be challenging. Make sure you totally understand everything and can explain it in simple terms. Do practice presenting before you go live.

Remember that even the most technical presentation should be easy to comprehend, visually appealing, and engaging to grab your audience's attention and make them understand the benefits of the AWS service.Here are some potential improvements you can make for each slide:

1. Introduction: Include an agenda outlining what the presentation will cover and the expected outcomes of the presentation.

2. Benefits of Cloud Computing: Try to explain each concept in more simple terms. For example, for the point 'Trade upfront expense for variable expense', you can clarify with 'Avoid large initial investments and pay-as-you-go based on usage'.

3. Types of Deployment: Ensure that each point is clear and concise. A diagram illustrating the different types of deployment could be useful.

4. Cloud Migration: This slide may be too text-heavy. Consider breaking up text into bullet points or visual elements such as infographics or charts. Also, use concise language and avoid too many buzzwords.

5. EC2: Consider adding some visual examples or use cases to illustrate the practical applications of EC2.

6. Serverless Computing: The explanation is good, but adding a real-world example or case study could help your audience understand better. Add some diagrams to aid the comprehension.

7. AWS Lambda: A flow diagram explaining how AWS Lambda works would be helpful.

8. S3 Buckets: This content is succinct and understandable. Adding a diagram to visualize buckets and objects may further enhance comprehension.

9. AWS Database services: For each service, consider including a practical application or a case study. 

10. RDS vs flat data placeholder: Again, a comparative table or diagram illustrating the differences would be helpful.

11. IAM: Use a diagram to show how IAM users, groups, and roles interact with each other and with AWS resources.

12. Have a go yourself: It's unclear what this slide is about. If it's a hands-on session or an interactive part, provide specific instructions, context, or questions to guide the audience.

Finally, ensure the use of consistent formatting and font styles throughout the slides to maintain a clean, professional appearance. Be sure to include a conclusion slide summarizing key takeaways, and invite questions or discussions at the end.
